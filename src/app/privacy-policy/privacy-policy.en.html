<h3>General Information on the Legal Basis for Data Processing on This Website</h3>
<p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR, if special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9(1) GDPR. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also based on Art. 49(1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information on your device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing is also based on § 25(1) TDDDG.

<h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
<p>In the course of our business activities, we work with various external parties. In some cases, the transfer of personal data to these external parties is also necessary. We only pass on personal data to external parties if this is necessary within the framework of contract fulfillment, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g., transfer of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR in the transfer, or if another legal basis permits the data transfer. When using processors, we only pass on personal data of our customers on the basis of a valid contract for order processing. In the case of joint processing, a contract for joint processing is concluded.</p>

<h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
<p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent that has already been given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>

<h3>Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
<p>IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AT ANY TIME TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE ASSERTION, EXERCISE, OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).</p>
<p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2) GDPR).</p>

<h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
<p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work, or the place of the alleged infringement. The right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>

<h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
<p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done to the extent that it is technically feasible.</p>

<h3>Right to Information, Deletion, and Correction</h3>
<p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient, and the purpose of data processing and, if applicable, a right to correction or deletion of this data. You can contact us at any time regarding this and other questions on the subject of personal data.</p>

<h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
<p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time regarding this. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to check this. For the duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
	<li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.</li>
	<li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend, or assert legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
	<li>If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data may – apart from their storage – only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.</p>

<h3>SSL or TLS Encryption</h3>
<p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from “http://” to “https://” and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>
<p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>

<h2>4. Data Collection on This Website</h2>
<h3>Contact Form</h3>
<p>If you send us inquiries via the contact form, your details from the inquiry form, including the contact details you provide there, will be stored by us for the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of follow-up questions. We do not pass on this data without your consent.</p>
<p>The processing of this data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, if your inquiry is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of the inquiries addressed to us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if this has been requested; consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
<p>The data you enter in the contact form will remain with us until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to storage, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after your request has been processed). Mandatory statutory provisions – in particular retention periods – remain unaffected.</p>
